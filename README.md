# Assignment_Myntra_UI_Framework - Myntra Home Furnishings Page Test

## _Introduction_ 
- Myntra is an eCommerce shopping website. 
- In the project, we will use a Hybrid Framework built using Maven, Java, Selenium, and TestNG.
- In the test, we have used @FindBy to store WebElements in the Page Object Model and have provided various generic ways to handle them using generic classes and methods.
- We have also included methods to handle test data through Excel sheets and properties files.

## _Getting Started_
To get started we need to perform the following steps:
1. We should have Eclipse Version: 2021-06 (4.20) installed.
2. We should have Java Version 11 installed.
3. We should have Chrome browser Version 116.0.5845.96 or above.
4. The other dependencies will be handled from the pom.xml file itself.

## _Dependencies used in framework_
1. selenium-java: Version 3.141.59
2. poi-ooxml: Version 4.1.1 (for xlsx type file for Excel 2007 and above)
3. poi: Version 4.1.1 (for xls type file for Excel 97-2007)
4. testng : Version 7.5.1
5. maven-compiler-plugin : Version 3.8.1
6. maven-surefire-plugin : Version 3.0.0-M5

5. Validate the search feature for a product.

## _Build and Test_
1. Import the .project in Eclipse as a maven project.
2. Check all dependencies are downloaded and no error is shown.
3. We can run the test in two ways either as TestNG test or as a Maven Test
  - To run as a TestNG test,
```bash
  myntratestng.xml-> Right Click -> Run As -> TestNG Suite.
```
  - To run as Maven test,
```bash
  pom.xml-> Right Click -> Run As -> Maven Test.
```
  


4. After the execution is completed the test report for both types of test can be seen as
  - For the TestNG test report,
```bash
  test-output-> Right-click on emailable-report.html -> Open with WebBrowser
  ```

  - For Maven test report, go to
